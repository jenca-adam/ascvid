``ascvid`` is an ASCII video player with quite exact results. It is mostly advised to be used under Linux, but it might work on Windows too (its behavior under Mac is untested, and it will likely not work well).
Here is a little showcase of what it can do:

It requires a Truecolor terminal to work like this. If you are on a stupider terminal, the results will look less realistic.The produced graphics aren't blinking as in other ASCII video players, however, the videos might lag a bit if your terminal is zoomed out.
``ascvid`` also supports audio output and pausing your video! It's a true video player.


Installation
============

.. code-block:: console
   
   python3 -m pip install ascvid

Then you can just run ``ascvid`` and you're good to go.

CLI Options
===========
*NOTE :: --no-truecolor option lags like my brain, so if you are on a stupid terminal, you are better off using --no-color in ASCII mode.*
.. code-block:: console
   
    Usage: ascvid [OPTIONS] FILE

    Options:
      -H, --hide-cursor       Hide the cursor while playing the video
      -A, --no-audio          Don't play audio stream
      -f, --fps TEXT          Number of FPS the video's supposed to run at. If
                              None, it's determined from the video. If "max",
                              ascvid will try its best to keep the video from
                              lagging
      -c, --char TEXT         Character to be used while rendering the video
                              frames
      -C, --no-color          Don't color output
      -a, --ascii             Use multiple ASCII characters. Best to be used with
                              --no-truecolor
      -T, --no-truecolor      Reduces color palette. Use this flag on more stupid
                              terminals (windows).
      -F, --fast              Toggles off resizing each frame individually, rather
                              resizes the entire video. Use this if the video is
                              lagging too much.
      -d, --disable-controls  Disables pausing the video
      -t, --title TEXT        Sets the title of the video. If not set, file name
                              will be used instead
      -h, --hide-title        hides the title
      -n, --new-window        Opens in a new terminal window
      -t, --term TEXT         Specify terminal in format '<terminal command> <run
                              command switch> {}'
      --help                  Show this message and exit.
